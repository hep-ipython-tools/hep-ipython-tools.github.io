	    <p>
		The HEP IPython project gives you a set of reoccuring tools to solve typical problems when using your software project with jupyter notebooks. 
		It is built to seemlessly interact with your software framework and give you all the functionality you want to have in your everyday jupyter usage, e.g.
		<ul>
		   <li>Show calculation information with interactive widgets which is the best method to show your content in jupyter notebooks.</li>
		   <li>Manage your processes with an easy-to use interface, which is suited for the interactive manner of jupyter notebooks.</li>
		   <li>Handle multiple processes and grid searches.</li>
		</ul>
It is best suited for HEP software but can also be used for many other use cases!
	    </p>
            <h2><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Show me!</h2>

            <p>
                The following short screencast shows the core functionality of the IPython tools in combination
                with the <a href="https://www.belle2.org/">Belle 2</a> software framework.

                In the video, a typical use case in HEP software is shown:
                <ul>
                    <li>Information on the environment are added to the notebook so that future user can directly see in
                        which context the calculation were made.
                    </li>
                    <li>A <code>path</code> object is created and filled with <code>modules</code>. A clickable help is used
                        to get information on the modules and their parameters.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <code>path</code> is processed and the added modules are executed.</li>
                    <li>Information on the calculation (e.g. statistics, logs, path content, data store content) are
                        received.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            The implementation of the <code>path</code> or the content of the <code>modules</code> is part of the Belle 2 software but interacts nicely with the IPython tools. For this, only a few lines of code were needed!
            </p>

            <h2><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>How can I use it?</h2>
	    <p>
		<!-- Add code example here! -->
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Look into the example notebooks on <a href="http://mybinder.org/repo/hep-ipython-tools/example-notebooks">binder</a>, if you want to see more of the functionalities in action!
	    </p>
      <p>
      You can also have a look into the code itself on <a href="https://github.com/hep-ipython-tools/hep-ipython-tools.git">github</a> and see how everything comes together.
